# calendar-app

## Description
This project is designed to help utilize bootstrap, jquery, and local storage in order to create a calendar scheduling application that will save items we have added to a website. Overall, I'm hoping that my use of the website along with the utilization of new tools will help give me a better understanding of how complex and helpful bootstrap and jquery can be in order to complete challenging requests. 

This process has been very fun and exciting. Learning how to create tools that can be utilized every day does not appear to be as daunting; however, putting it all together is very rewarding.

I would like to make a shout out to my previous instructor Jesslyn and my current instructor Matt, for guiding all of us through these challenging lessons/modules and helping us learn about jquery and bootstrap.
